## 🚀 Quick Start (1 Hour)

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Add to Vercel (CRITICAL)
Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard/stakesmith/settings/environment-variables

Add these variables:
```
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = pk_live_your_stripe_public_key_here
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = sk_live_your_stripe_secret_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = pk_live_your_stripe_public_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL = https://stakesmith.com
```

### 3. Create Stripe Products
Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/products

Create two products:
- **Pro**: $9.99/month (copy Price ID)
- **VIP**: $29.99/month (copy Price ID)

Add to Vercel:
```
STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID = price_xxxxx
STRIPE_VIP_PRICE_ID = price_xxxxx
```

### 4. Set Up Webhook
Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks

Add endpoint:
- URL: `https://stakesmith.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
- Events: subscription.created, subscription.updated, subscription.deleted, invoice.payment_succeeded, invoice.payment_failed, charge.refunded

Copy Signing Secret and add to Vercel:
```
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET = whsec_xxxxx
```

### 5. Deploy
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Stripe integration"
git push origin main
```

### 6. Test
- Go to `/pricing`
- Click "Upgrade to Pro"
- Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- Verify subscription in Firestore

---

## 📊 How It Works

### Payment Flow:
```
User clicks "Upgrade"
    ↓
Checkout API verifies Firebase token
    ↓
Creates Stripe checkout session
    ↓
Redirects to Stripe payment page
    ↓
User enters payment info
    ↓
Stripe processes payment
    ↓
Webhook notifies your app
    ↓
Firestore updated with subscription
    ↓
User sees Pro/VIP features
```

### Data Structure (Firestore):
```javascript
// subscriptions/{userId}
{
  userId: "user123",
  tier: "pro",
  stripeCustomerId: "cus_xxx",
  stripeSubscriptionId: "sub_xxx",
  status: "active",
  currentPeriodStart: Timestamp,
  currentPeriodEnd: Timestamp,
  updatedAt: Timestamp
}

// usage/{userId}-{date}
{
  userId: "user123",
  date: "12/17/2024",
  count: 3,
  createdAt: Timestamp
}
```

## 🔒 Security

✅ **Implemented:**
- Secret keys stored in Vercel (encrypted)
- Webhook signature verification
- Firebase auth required for checkout
- Firestore rules prevent cross-user access
- HTTPS enforced

⚠️ **Remember:**
- Never commit `.env.local` to git
- Never share secret keys
- Rotate keys if compromised
- Monitor webhook failures

---

## 📈 Monitoring

### Stripe Dashboard:
- https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments - View transactions
- https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks - Check webhook status
- https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers - View customers

### Firestore:
- Collections → subscriptions - User subscription tiers
- Collections → usage - Strategy generation tracking

### Vercel:
- Deployments → Logs - Check for errors
- Real-time monitoring of webhook processing

---

## 🐛 Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Checkout failed" | Check STRIPE_SECRET_KEY in Vercel |
| "Webhook not working" | Verify webhook URL and signing secret |
| "Subscription not updating" | Wait 30s, check Firestore, verify webhook |
| "Payment succeeded but no subscription" | Check Stripe Dashboard webhook delivery |
| "Build failed" | Run `npm run build` locally to debug |

---

## 💰 Revenue Tracking

### Key Metrics:
```
MRR = (Pro users × $9.99) + (VIP users × $29.99)
Conversion Rate = (Paying users / Total users) × 100
Churn Rate = (Canceled / Total) × 100
LTV = (ARPU × Lifetime) / Churn Rate
```

### Monitor in Stripe Dashboard:
- Payments → View all transactions
- Customers → Track active subscriptions
- Reports → Revenue analytics
