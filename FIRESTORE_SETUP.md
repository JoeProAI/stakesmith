    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Users can read/write their own transactions
    match /transactions/{transactionId} {
      allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;
      allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
    }
    
    // Users can read/write/update/delete their own blueprints
    match /blueprints/{blueprintId} {
      allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;
      allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
      allow update, delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
