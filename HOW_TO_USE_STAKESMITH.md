# 📘 How to Get the Most Out of StakeSmith

## 🏈 The Weekly Strategy

StakeSmith is designed around the **NFL weekly schedule**. Here's how to maximize your results:

---

## 📅 **Weekly Workflow**

### **Wednesday (Reset Day)**
**🎯 Goal: Initial Strategy Generation**

1. **Review upcoming games** (Thursday, Sunday, Monday)
2. **Generate your 15 strategies**
   - Free users: 1 generation (use it wisely!)
   - Pro users: Generate initial baseline
3. **Study the strategies**:
   - Which odds look favorable?
   - Any injury concerns?
   - Weather impacts?
4. **Don't place bets yet!** Lines will move

**💡 Pro Tip:** Early in the week = softer lines. Wait for value.

---

### **Thursday (Line Movement Begins)**
**🎯 Goal: Line Shopping & Refinement**

1. **Check line movements**
   - Sharp money moving lines?
   - Injury news affecting odds?
2. **Regenerate strategies** (Pro users)
   - Get updated odds
   - See which strategies improve
3. **Compare Wednesday vs Thursday**
   - Which bets got better value?
   - Any new opportunities?

**💡 Pro Tip:** If a spread moves from -3.5 to -3, regenerate to capture better odds.

---

### **Friday-Saturday (Prime Line Shopping)**
**🎯 Goal: Find Peak Value**

1. **Regenerate 2-3 times** (Pro users)
   - Lines move most on Friday/Saturday
   - Public money creates inefficiencies
2. **Look for line value**:
   - Key numbers (3, 7 in NFL spreads)
   - Totals moving with weather forecasts
   - Prop lines adjusting to news
3. **Identify your best 3-5 bets**
4. **Save to dashboard** (Pro users)

**💡 Pro Tip:** Don't chase every strategy. Pick 2-3 with best value + confidence.

---

### **Sunday Morning (Final Prep)**
**🎯 Goal: Lock In Bets**

1. **One final regeneration** (Pro users)
   - Get absolute latest lines
   - Check for late injury news
2. **Review saved strategies**
3. **Place your bets**:
   - Start with smaller stakes (1-2% bankroll)
   - Don't bet every strategy
4. **Track in dashboard** (Pro users)

**💡 Pro Tip:** If you can't decide between 2 parlays, bet smaller on both rather than full stake on one.

---

### **Sunday-Monday (Game Days)**
**🎯 Goal: Enjoy & Track**

1. **Watch your bets play out**
2. **Don't chase losses**
   - Stick to your pre-game plan
   - No emotional live betting
3. **Take notes** (Pro users):
   - Which strategies hit?
   - Why did some miss?
   - Any patterns?

**💡 Pro Tip:** The best bettors learn from losses, not just wins.

---

### **Tuesday (Settlement & Review)**
**🎯 Goal: Learn & Improve**

1. **Settle your bets** (Pro users):
   - Mark Won/Lost in dashboard
   - Update your bankroll
2. **Review performance**:
   - What's your win rate?
   - Which strategy types work best?
   - Any consistent edges?
3. **Adjust strategy**:
   - More of what works
   - Less of what doesn't
4. **Plan for next week**

**💡 Pro Tip:** Track which AI strategies consistently perform. Double down on those next week.

## 🎓 **Strategy Types: When to Use**

### **High-Value Strategies (Best for Experienced)**
- **High Roller**: Large underdogs, high risk/reward

**When to use:** Small stakes (0.5-1% bankroll), occasional shots

---

### **Balanced Strategies (Best for Most Users)**
- **Balanced Attack**: Mix of favs + props
- **Power Parlay**: 4-leg mixed markets

**When to use:** Regular play (1-2% bankroll), weekly bets

---

### **Conservative Strategies (Best for Beginners)**

- **First Half**: Lower variance (less scoring)
- **VIP Stakes**: High confidence picks

**When to use:** Larger stakes (2-3% bankroll), building confidence

---

### **Prop Strategies (Best for Deep Knowledge)**
- **QB Props**: Know QB tendencies
- **RB Rush**: Understand run game matchups

**When to use:** If you follow specific players/teams closely

---

## 💰 **Bankroll Management**

### **The Golden Rules:**
1. **Never bet more than 5% on one parlay**
2. **Keep 80%+ of bankroll in reserve**
3. **Start small, scale up with wins**

### **Suggested Stakes by Strategy Type:**
```
High Risk (Longshot, High Roller):     0.5-1% of bankroll
Medium Risk (Most strategies):          1-2% of bankroll  
Low Risk (Safe Money, VIP Stakes):      2-3% of bankroll
```

### **Example ($500 Bankroll):**
```
High Roller:      $5 stake   (1%)
Power Parlay:     $10 stake  (2%)
Safe Money:       $15 stake  (3%)

Total Weekly Risk: $30 (6% of bankroll)
```

**💡 Pro Tip:** Never risk more than 10% of bankroll in one week.

## 🧪 **Using Monte Carlo Simulations**

### **What It Shows:**
- **Expected Value**: Long-term profit/loss
- **Win Probability**: Chance of hitting
- **Confidence Interval**: Range of outcomes

### **How to Use It:**
1. Generate a strategy
2. Click "🔬 Simulate"
3. Review results:
   - Positive EV? Good sign
   - Win prob > 20%? Reasonable
   - Confidence interval? Know your range

### **When to Trust It:**
- ✅ Positive EV + 15%+ win prob = Good bet
- ⚠️ Negative EV but high win prob = Possible (low odds)
- ❌ Negative EV + low win prob = Skip it

**💡 Pro Tip:** Simulations are guides, not guarantees. Use for comparison, not absolute truth.

## 🚫 **What NOT to Do**

### **Don't:**
1. ❌ **Bet every strategy** - Pick 2-3 best
2. ❌ **Chase losses** - Stick to your stakes
3. ❌ **Ignore line movement** - Regenerate when lines shift
4. ❌ **Bet without tracking** - You won't learn what works
5. ❌ **Increase stakes after losses** - Recipe for disaster
6. ❌ **Blindly follow AI** - Use your judgment
7. ❌ **Bet your rent money** - Entertainment, not income

## 📊 **Tracking Your Performance**

### **Key Metrics to Watch:**
1. **Overall Win Rate**
   - Target: 35-45% for parlays
   - Above 40%? You're doing great
2. **ROI (Return on Investment)**
   - Target: Positive over 10+ weeks
   - Break-even is actually good for parlays

## 💡 **Advanced Tips**

### **Line Shopping Across Books:**
Even 0.5 points matters in a parlay:
```
Book A: Chiefs -3.5 (-110)
Book B: Chiefs -3.0 (-110)

Take Book B! Better chance to push instead of lose.
```

### **Correlated Parlays:**
Some bets help each other:
```
✅ Good: QB Over yards + His WR Over yards
✅ Good: Team ML + Over total
❌ Bad: Team -7 + Under total (contradictory)
```

### **Weather Watch:**
Check forecasts before Sunday:
```
Wind 20+ mph: Take unders, avoid prop overs
Rain/Snow: Take unders, run-heavy teams
Dome games: Overs more reliable
```

### **Key Numbers:**
NFL spreads land on 3 and 7 most often:
```
-3.5 is way better than -4
-6.5 is way better than -7.5
Shop for these!
```
