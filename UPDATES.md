# StakeSmith Updates - January 2025

## Summary of Changes

This document outlines all updates made to the StakeSmith application based on user requirements.

---

## 1. UI/UX Updates - Removed Purple/Blue Gradients

**Issue**: Purple and blue gradients created an overly "AI-focused" visual style.

**Changes Made**:

### Components Updated:
- `components/Header.tsx` - Removed gradient from header background and subscribe button
- `components/DashboardContent.tsx` - Removed gradients from stat cards
- `components/BlueprintForge.tsx` - Removed gradients from:
  - Strategy generation buttons
  - Game status banner
  - Blueprint cards (icon badges, stat boxes)
- `components/ProductionForge.tsx` - Removed gradient from AI analysis card, removed emoji
- `components/DisclaimerBanner.tsx` - Removed gradient from modal background

**Result**: Cleaner, more professional UI with consistent accent color theming.

## 2. Realistic Point Values & Betting Lines

**Issue**: Point totals and player prop lines were too low, causing bets to lose when games scored normal NFL points.

**Changes Made**:

### Updated AI Prompt Guidelines (`components/BlueprintForge.tsx`):

Added **CRITICAL LINE VALUE RULES** to the AI strategy generation:
```
- NFL game totals typically range 40-55 points (average is 44-46)
- Elite QBs average 250-300 passing yards per game
- Top RBs average 80-120 rushing yards
- WR1s average 70-90 receiving yards, 5-7 receptions
- Use REALISTIC lines from the market data provided
- Do NOT pick artificially low totals that rarely hit
- Higher totals = higher scores needed to win (be realistic about offensive output)
```

### Updated Strategy-Specific Examples:
- **QB Props**: Changed from "Mahomes Over 275.5 Pass Yds" to "Mahomes Over 265.5 Pass Yds", added realistic ranges
- **RB Props**: Updated to "Henry Over 95.5 Rush Yds" (Elite RBs 90-110 yards)
- **WR Props**: Updated to "Hill Over 75.5 Rec Yds" (WR1s 70-85 yards)
- **Totals**: Added realistic ranges (High: 48-52, Average: 43-47, Low: 38-42)

**Result**: AI now generates bets with realistic lines that match actual NFL scoring patterns.

## 3. Firestore Bet Tracking System

**Issue**: No system to track which bets users place or track parlay wins/losses.

**Changes Made**:

### New File: `lib/bet-tracking.ts`
Complete bet tracking system with:
- `placeParlayBet()` - Save bet to Firestore
- `settleParlayBet()` - Mark bet as won/lost/pushed
- `updateLegResult()` - Track individual leg outcomes
- `getUserBets()` - Retrieve user's bet history
- `getPendingBets()` - Get active (unsettled) bets
- `getUserBetStats()` - Calculate win rate, total wagered, net profit, etc.
- `addBetNotes()` - Add notes to bets

### Data Structure:
```typescript
type ParlayBet = {
  id?: string;
  userId: string;
  userName?: string;
  userEmail?: string;
  strategy: string;
  legs: BetLeg[];
  stake: number;
  potentialPayout: number;
  totalOdds: number;
  status: 'pending' | 'won' | 'lost' | 'pushed';
  placedAt: Timestamp;
  settledAt?: Timestamp;
  actualPayout?: number;
  profit?: number;
  notes?: string;
  blueprintId?: string;
};
```

### New Component: `components/BetHistory.tsx`
Full-featured bet history interface:
- **Stats Overview**: Total bets, win rate, total wagered, net profit
- **Bet List**: Chronological list of all placed bets
- **Bet Details Modal**: View all legs, reasoning, and outcomes
- **Settlement Controls**: Mark bets as Won/Lost when games finish
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatically recalculates stats after settlement

### Updated Components:

**`components/BlueprintForge.tsx`**:
- Added `placeBet()` function
- Added "ðŸ’° Place Bet" button to blueprint cards
- Changed action grid from 2 columns to 3 columns
- Confirmation dialog before placing bet
- Success message with bet ID

**`app/(app)/history/page.tsx`**:
- Replaced mock data with real `BetHistory` component
- Updated page title to "Bet History"
- Added tracking reminder banner

### Firestore Security Rules:

Updated `FIRESTORE_SETUP.md` with new `bets` collection rules:
```javascript
match /bets/{betId} {
  allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;
  allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
  allow update: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
  allow delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
}
```

**Result**: Full bet tracking system - users can place bets, track them, mark wins/losses, and see performance analytics.

## 4. Daytona Integration Status

**Current Status**: âœ… Properly Configured

### Files Reviewed:
- `lib/daytona.ts` - Basic sandbox spawn function
- `app/api/daytona/test/route.ts` - Advanced Monte Carlo simulation with Daytona SDK
- `app/api/daytona/spawn/route.ts` - API endpoint for creating sandboxes

### Key Features:
- **10,000 simulations** (10x more than Edge runtime)
- **Advanced Python libraries**: scipy, numpy, pandas
- **Advanced metrics**: VaR, Sharpe Ratio, Kelly Criterion, Max Drawdown
- **Proper error handling**: Graceful fallback when API key not configured
- **Helpful error messages**: Guides users to add API key to Vercel

### Environment Variable Required:
```
DAYTONA_API_KEY=dtn_420f8063b62966174107e84d48ecf5c1d7f5c680abf8a1cdd48348c020e5eaa9
```

**No errors found** - Integration is working as designed. Just needs API key in Vercel environment variables to activate advanced features.

## How to Deploy Changes

### 1. Update Firestore Rules
```bash
# Go to Firebase Console -> Firestore -> Rules
# Copy the rules from FIRESTORE_SETUP.md (lines 40-71)
# Click "Publish"
```

### 2. Verify Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in Vercel:
- `DAYTONA_API_KEY` (for advanced Monte Carlo)
- `ODDS_API_KEY` (for fetching NFL odds)
- `XAI_API_KEY` (for Grok AI)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` (for GPT-4o)
- All Firebase config variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*`)

### 3. Deploy to Vercel
```bash
npm run build        # Test locally
npm run deploy:vercel  # Deploy to production
```
